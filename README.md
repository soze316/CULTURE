# The CULTURE DAO

The Culture is a new guild for Virtual Beings, Avatars, Digital Identity.

The Culture Guild grows out of the 5700 folks on the Virtual Beings Facebook group, the 1000 plus Virtual-beings-summit.com attendees and the artists, engineers, founders, technologists working flat out every day to create the avatars, virtual beings and digital identities that will power the metaverse.

With the rise of the metaverse, and with over a billion dollars spent on avatar NFTs (that number is for cryptopunks alone), the world is rapidly embracing 1. Virtual Beings 2. Avatars 3. Digital Identity.


<b>Meet the new guilds… same as the old guilds</b>

In the Renaissance — the portrait was a way to express one’s arrival, status and role in society.

Artists were paid handsomely for the hundreds of thousands paintings needed for the emerging trading class to claim their place in society.

David Hockney, in ‘Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters’⁶ , described the way that Guilds allowed huge technical advances around painting by sharing Secret Knowledge among trusted peers. These guilds were able to move artistic techniques centuries forward in just a few decades during the Renaissance — and to produce the paintings which the emerging trading class required to show their status.

The emerging metaverse class will require multiples of 8 billion living portraits of themselves. And the more ambitious of the metaverse class will have multiple synthetic identities — some AI powered, some expressive of sides of their personality — And The Culture Guild will help create them.

<b>Can you join The Culture Guild?</b>

The Culture Guild is for those slightly unhinged folks who are fascinated by becoming digital people, creating digital people — and want to learn, contribute and trade knowledge around a skill (building avatars, virtual beings, digital identity) that will only grow in value over the coming century as the species digitizes.

There is a famous quote from the founding year of Italy, normally a patchwork of city states: “We have made Italy. Now we must make Italians” — and so it is with the metaverse: We have made so much of the metaverse. Now we must begin to make metaverse citizens.

Avatars, virtual beings and digital identity is how you become a true citizen of the metaverse.
